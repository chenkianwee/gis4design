# INTRODUCTION
This book is a step-by-step guide for using QuantumGIS (QGIS) to perform site analysis in the urban (& architectural) design process. QGIS is an open-source GIS platform that is freely available. This is not a complete guide to QGIS, but just explains a collection of features in QGIS that are useful for design. This guide is written for QGIS 3.16. You can install QGIS 3.16 <a href="https://www.qgis.org/en/site/" target="_blank">here</a>

## How to Use This Book
The book is divided into 3 parts. The **First Part: Concepts** covers basic concepts about GIS. The **Second Part: Workflows** covers workflows for achieving a spatial analysis. Each workflow is a combination of multiple tasks. The **Third Part: Tasks** covers individual task that performs a basic function. You can string multiple tasks into a workflow to achieve an objective. Usually in the design process, designers have to perform a series of these tasks to produce a mapping.

You can search through the whole book with the search bar. Please use the search bar to find relevant workflows and tasks for your purpose.
