## How to Use This Book
The book is divided into 3 parts. The **First Part: Concepts** covers basic concepts about GIS. The **Second Part: Workflows** covers workflows for achieving a spatial analysis. Each workflow is a combination of multiple tasks. The **Third Part: Tasks** covers individual task that performs a basic function. You can string multiple tasks into a workflow to achieve an objective. Usually in the design process, designers have to perform a series of these tasks to produce a mapping.
