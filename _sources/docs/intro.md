# INTRODUCTION
This book is a step-by-step guide for using GIS to perform site analysis in the urban & architectural design process. The main GIS platform used for handling geospatial data is the open-source QGIS platform that is freely available. This is not a complete guide to QGIS, but just explains a collection of features in QGIS that are useful for design. This guide is written for QGIS 3.16. You can install QGIS 3.16 <a href="https://www.qgis.org/en/site/" target="_blank">here</a>. For some of the workflows I have used other open-source and freely available tools to process the data. In principle, I have tried to used open-source tools for the workflows to make sure they are openly accessible.   

## How to Use This Book
The book is divided into 3 parts. The **First Part: Concepts** covers basic concepts about GIS. The **Second Part: Workflows** covers workflows for achieving a spatial analysis. Each workflow is a combination of multiple tasks. The **Third Part: Tasks** covers individual task that performs a basic function. You can string multiple tasks into a workflow to achieve an objective. Usually in the design process, designers have to perform a series of these tasks to produce a mapping.
